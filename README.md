# COG Summer Workshops 2024

The Coding Outreach Group (COG) weekly summer workshops are interactive, live tutorials led by skilled programers who use their expertise to teach you a specific research skill or topic. These workshops aim to be as hands-on as possible. Some topics build upon techniques, skills, and analyses discussed in previous years ([2023](https://github.com/TU-Coding-Outreach-Group/cog_summer_workshops_2023), [2022](https://github.com/TU-Coding-Outreach-Group/cog_summer_workshops_2022), [2021](https://github.com/TU-Coding-Outreach-Group/cog_summer_workshops_2021), and [2020](https://github.com/TU-Coding-Outreach-Group/cog_summer_workshops_2020)). While this year's cirriculum is R-heavy, previous offerings have included tutorials in javascript and html, matlab, and python. The prerequisite knowledge and resources needed to successfully follow along may change from workshop to workshop, so please be sure to check the github page for each workshop that you plan to attend. People who are new to programming are welcome to attend, but may not receive the adequate help needed to follow along with the content. If you would like to learn some basic coding, we have a [list of tutorials](https://github.com/TU-Coding-Outreach-Group/Tutorials/blob/master/index.md) for various programming languages.

If you aren't familiar and are having trouble with downloading the materials, consider [checking this tutorial that outlines a few ways to download Github files and repositories](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/download-from-github).
