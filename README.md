# COG Summer Workshops 2024

The Coding Outreach Group (COG) weekly summer workshops focus on a specific research skill or topic and aim to have participants actively involved. These workshops try to be as hands-on as possible and for attendees to get the most out of the workshops, they should ideally already have some basic coding experience (i.e., be able to run an analysis in at least one coding language). Some topics build upon techniques, skills, and analyses discussed in previous years ([2023](https://github.com/TU-Coding-Outreach-Group/cog_summer_workshops_2023),[2022](https://github.com/TU-Coding-Outreach-Group/cog_summer_workshops_2022), [2021](https://github.com/TU-Coding-Outreach-Group/cog_summer_workshops_2021) and [2020](https://github.com/TU-Coding-Outreach-Group/cog_summer_workshops_2020)). People new to coding are welcome to attend but may not receive the adequate help needed to follow along with the content. If you would like to learn some basic coding, we have a [list of tutorials](https://github.com/TU-Coding-Outreach-Group/Tutorials/blob/master/index.md) for various programming languages.

If you aren't familiar and are having trouble with downloading the materials, consider [checking this tutorial that outlines a few ways to download Github files and repositories](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/download-from-github).
