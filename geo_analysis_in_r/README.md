## Description
This workshop will cover geospatial analysis and mapmaking (cartography) in R! We will start with an overview of mapmaking principles and highlight important decisions to consider when creating maps. Then, we will walk through how to make a basic map using native ggplot functions and datasets before diving into three specialized approaches. We will use online, open source data (e.g., OpenStreetMap, online data repositories) to create and customize maps. Attendees will have the opportunity to apply geospatial data analytics in this tutorial and explore online resources and upcoming mapmaking challenges as avenues to continue learning.

## Prerequisites
This workshop demands that users:
1. have the R programming language downloaded, which can be accessed here:(https://archive.linux.duke.edu/cran/)
2. have the R Studio user interface downloaded, which can be accessed here:(https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
3. have the packages listed in the following R script installed: (See index.html for instructions)
4. have a proficiency with the R programming language
5. have a basic familiarity with plotting data in R; previous primers can be accessed here: (https://github.com/TU-Coding-Outreach-Group/cog_summer_workshops_2021/tree/main/data-visualization-in-r) 

## Set Up (do before the workshop)
1. Download the R Markdown script from github
2. Download the dataset for the workshop
3. Download the relevant packages (See [Notebook Viewer](https://tu-coding-outreach-group.github.io/cog_summer_workshops_2024/geo_analysis_in_r/index.html) below)

## Other Relevant COG Workshops:
COG Workshops are often iterative; they build upon other workshops that we've already created. If you are unfamiliar with this topic, we recommend taking a look at some of our previous workshops to build some familiarity:
