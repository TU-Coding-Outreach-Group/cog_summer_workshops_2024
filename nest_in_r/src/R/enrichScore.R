#' function to calculate enrichment score given a map of brain-phenotype associations & network labels
#'@param stat.map - vector (length V) of location (v)-specific associations
#'@param net.map - vector (also length V) consisting of all 0's, 1's. It is assumed that 1's denote locations inside the network of interest, and 0's denote all other locations
#'@param one.sided - default is TRUE, so that the running sum statistic increases in increments proportional to the magnitude of T(v) at a given location in the network; setting one.sided = FALSE will change the increment for locations in the network to increase by 1/(# locations in network)
#'@param save.detail - default is FALSE, so that the calculated enrichment score is the only information returned. it can be set to FALSE to return additional information used to calculate the enrichment score
