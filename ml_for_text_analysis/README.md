## Description
This week's workshop dives into predictive modeling using text data with R! Specifically, we'll be using customer reviews to predict ratings for different types of coffee. We'll start by exploring the data, continue through feature engineering with packages like tidytext and tidymodels, and compare various regression models. The workshop highlights hands-on techniques for data visualization, model evaluation, and the interpretation of results. By the end, attendees will be equipped to apply these methods to their own datasets, enhancing their ability to analyze and predict outcomes from text data.

## Prerequisites
This workshop requires that users:
1. have the R programming language downloaded, which can be accessed here:(https://archive.linux.duke.edu/cran/)
2. have the R Studio user interface downloaded, which can be accessed here:(https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
3. have the packages listed in the following R script installed: (See index.html for instructions)
4. have a basic proficiency with the R programming language
5. have a basic familiarity with plotting data in R; previous primers can be accessed here: (https://github.com/TU-Coding-Outreach-Group/cog_summer_workshops_2021/tree/main/data-visualization-in-r) 

## Set Up (do before the workshop)
1. Download the R Markdown script from github
2. Download the dataset for the workshop
3. Download the relevant packages (See below)

## Workshop objectives:
1. Implement common feature engineering steps for text data
2. Use workflow sets to evaluate and compare different types of regression models and preprocessing steps
3. Visualize results!

## What We Won't Cover:
Since we are focusing on regression models (i.e., predicting continuous outcomes), we will not be covering classification models (i.e., predicting groups).
